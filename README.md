# CSS Grid Static Practice

1. Clone this repository to your 'code' directory
1. Navigate to the project root
1. Open project in VS Code with `code .`
1. Open all three frontend files and and the example image
1. Make your project look like the example image (hint: multiple items can have `display: grid;`)
    - Note that the header and footer dimensions are accidentally reversed.  They should read 1000px x 100px and 1000px x 150px
1. Add code ONLY to the `layout.css` file
